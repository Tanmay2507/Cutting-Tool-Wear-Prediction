# Cutting-Tool-Wear-Prediction
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict cutting tool wear, helping optimize machining processes by minimizing downtime and reducing costs. By analyzing machining data, such as cutting speed, feed rate, and material types, the model predicts when tools are likely to wear out, enabling timely maintenance and improved efficiency.  

## Dataset  
The model utilizes tool wear data sourced from machining experiments, either from publicly available datasets or simulations.  

## Resources  
- [Scikit-learn Documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/)  
- [Machine Learning Mastery: A Gentle Introduction to Regression Algorithms](https://machinelearningmastery.com/)  
- Online courses, e.g., *Practical Machine Learning for Engineers*  
- Research papers on cutting tool wear and influencing factors  

## Features  
- Collect and preprocess data on cutting parameters (speed, feed rate, material types) for accuracy.  
- Engineer features like tool geometry and environmental factors.  
- Develop predictive models using advanced algorithms such as Random Forest or Neural Networks.  
- Optimize model parameters to improve performance.
